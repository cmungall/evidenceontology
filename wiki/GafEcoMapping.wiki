#Mapping Gene Association Format files to ECO

 * Permanent URL for mapping: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/eco/gaf-eco-mapping.txt

This mapping translates evidence codes used in a GAF to a specific evidence type in ECO

Each mapping is from a pair:
 # GAF evidence code (e.g. IEA)
 # A GO_REF (found in the GAF With column) to a class identifier in ECO (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/eco.owl)
 # ECO ID

If the value 'Default' is in column 2 then this mapping is used if
no more specific mapping can be found

This document consists of these comments (after s) followed by
a set of mappings, each represented as the above 3 columns separated by tabs

For example an IEA supported by
 http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/references.cgi#GO_REF:0000002
maps to ECO:0000256 'match to sequence model evidence used in automatic assertion'
