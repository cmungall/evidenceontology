def: "A type of differential stain evidence where crystal violet is used as the primary dye and safranin is used as the counterstain. The stain is named after\nHans Christain Gram who developed it in 1894 while working with Carl Friedl√§nder in the Berlin city morge. The gram stain is used to separate bacteria into two major categories gram positive and gram negative, gram positive having thick peptidoglycan and the gram negative having thin peptidoglycan. The protocol for the stain is a application of the crystal violet followed by Gram's iodine as the mordant, ethyl alcohol as a decolorizer, and safranin as the counterstain." [ECO:KAV, PMCID:PMC180726]
comment: The original formula for the gram stain consisted of aniline-gentian violet, iodine-potassium iodide, absolute alcohol, and sometimes bismark brown.

The congo red is a PH indicator and it dries on the slide leaving a red background then manval's solution a mixture of acetic acid and acid fuchsin is added to the slide. The acid fuchsin stains the bacteria bright red and the acetic acid acts as a mordant." [ECO:KAV, PMID:19239855, PMID:23825728]
comment: Congo red is a pH indicator and changes color when exposed to different pH. It is blue below 3.0 pH and will turn red if exposed to a pH above 5.2. Due to this when a maneval's stain is done the slide shows red white and blue red and blue for the background while the bacteria is stained red by the acid fuchsin the capsule remains white. The slide must be rinsed at the end and not blot dried because of the same reason it cannot be heat fixed because those actions would destroy or damage the destroy the capsule.

Other lipodial emulsions can be created by using meal, cream , vegetable oil, or olive oil.

def: "A type of selective solid agar medium evidence originally used for the cultivation of the Legionella species. The agar media contains yeast extracts, charcoal activated, ACES buffer, l-cysteine hcl, and a-ketogultarate monopotassium salt. In recent studies the agar media has been shown the ability to culture other species of microorganisms including Brucellae, Nocardia and Ancanthamoeba keratitis." [ECO:KAV, PMID:2116452, PMID:393713, PMID:7009642, PMID:9780107, PMID:PMC265402]
comment: The media has been modified many times over the years. Legionella pneumophila was first discovered in 1977 by MacDade et al. In 1979 Feeley et al developed a medium that provided consistent isolation of Legionella. He later modified that media by replacing casein hydrolase with yeast and beef extract. In 1980 Pasculle et al added the ACES buffer giving the media the designation BCYE ( buffered charcoal yeast extract). During 1981 Edelstien et al. Increased the sensitivity of the media by adding alpha-ketoglutaric potsasium salt. During that same year the media was made even more selective for Legionella by Wadowsky and Yee by adding the antibiotics glycine, vancomycin, and polymyxin. The latest modification was made in 1984 by Dennis et al. By adding cycloheximide creating GVPC medium.
