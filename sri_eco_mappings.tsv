EV-AS	Author statement	Author statement. The evidence for an assertion comes from an author statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support for the assertion. Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.	author statement	ECO:0000204	A documented statement evidence that is based on an assertion by the author of a paper, which is read by a curator.
EV-AS-TAS	Traceable author statement	Traceable author statement. The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the assertion. The statement referenced another publication that supported the assertion, but it is unclear whether that publication described an experiment that supported the assertion. The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was not done to support the assertion. In general, references to the primary literature are preferred, but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.	author statement supported by traceable reference	ECO:0000033	A type of author statement in which the author makes a statement that is not supported by information in that particular publication, but rather can be traced to a reference cited by that publication.

EV–Exp–IPI	Inferred from physical interaction	IPI inferred from physical interaction.The assertion was inferred from a physical interaction such as 1) 2-hybrid interactions 2) Co-purification 3) Co-immunoprecipitation 4)Ion/protein binding experiments. This code covers physical interactions between the gene product of interest and another molecule (or ion, or complex). For functions such as protein binding or nucleic acid binding, a binding assay is simultaneously IPI and IDA; IDA is preferred because the assay directly detects the binding. For both IPI and IGI, it would be good practice to qualify them with the gene/protein/ion.	physical interaction evidence	ECO:0000021	A type of experimental evidence that is based on characterization of an interaction between a gene product and another molecule.
EV–Exp–IMP	Inferred from mutant phenotype	IMP inferred from mutant phenotype. The assertion was inferred from a mutant phenotype such as 1) Any gene mutation/knockout 2) Overexpression/ectopic expression of wild-type or mutant genes 3) Anti-sense experiments 4) RNA interference experiments 5) Specific protein inhibitors 6) Complementation. Comment: Inferences made from examining mutations or abnormal levels of only the product(s) of the gene of interest are covered by code EV-IMP (compare to code EV-IGI). Use this code for experiments that use antibodies or other specific inhibitors of RNA or protein activity, even though no gene may be mutated (the rationale is that EV-IMP is used where an abnormal situation prevails in a cell or organism).	mutant phenotype evidence	ECO:0000015	A type of experimental phenotypic evidence in which an observable phenotypic difference results from a change or mutation in DNA, reflecting a different form of an allele.

EV–Exp–IGI	Inferred from genetic interaction	IGI inferred from genetic interaction. The assertion was inferred from a genetic interaction such as 1) Traditional genetic interactions such as suppressors, synthetic lethals, etc. 2) Functional complementation 3) Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene.This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence (mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI than IMP annotations.). IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI). We have also decided to use this category for situations where a mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function, process, or component of another gene (gene B; i.e. annotate gene B using IGI).	genetic interaction evidence	ECO:0000011	A type of experimental phenotypic evidence resulting from the effect that a given gene has on another gene or genes, and the products.

EV–Exp–IEP–Gene–Expression–Analysis	Gene expression analysis	The expression of the gene is analyzed through a transcriptional fusion (i.e. lacZ), and a difference in expression levels is observed when the regulatory protein is present (wild type) vs in its absence.
