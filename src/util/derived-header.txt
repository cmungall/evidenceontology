# About:
# This maps specific ECO terms to more general GO evidence codes. 
# This file is automatically generated based on the annotation property "has GO evidence code"
# that is attached to each ECO term. Values for "has GO evidence code" were initially populated 
# based on equivalence mappings of ECO high level terms to GO evidence codes (from 
# http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/eco/gaf-eco-mapping.txt) followed by propagation 
# of those GO evidence codes to the corresponding ECO child terms. 
# Currently, this field is populated as part of the term creation and curation process. 
# Child ECO terms may or may not be mapped to the same GO evidence code as their parents. 
# See PMID:34986598 for more details on this system.
# The lines that contain "Default" in the third column are ECO terms with equivalent mappings to 
# GO evidence codes from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/eco/gaf-eco-mapping.txt.
#
# Each mapping line contains:
#  1. GAF evidence code (e.g. IEA)
#  2. ECO ID
#  3. Default (optional), if the ECO ID is equivalent to the GAF evidence code
#
# This document consists of these comments (after #s) followed by a set of mappings,
# each represented as the above 3 columns separated by tabs.
